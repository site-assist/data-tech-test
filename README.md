Welcome to the Data Scientist take home repo!

You will find one csv (dummy_data.csv) depicting our app’s backend live data. We are looking at the permits table which captures permits’ statuses such as user requests, closing once the work has been completed etc…


### First Task
> **Your first task here will be to try to infer at which state within the permit cycle a record is.**

***What we expect?***
1. Analyse the dataset the best of your capacity. Don’t be afraid to challenge it if you feel it is not complete. 
2. Create some quick insights and potential visualisation of the data (EDA).
3. Define and implement an approach to solve the question above.

### Second Task
> **Your second task will be to try to define the right funnel for the permit cycle along with some success metrics to measure it.**

***What we expect?***
1. Ability to create ways to label our data this could be used for both some DS projects as well as for internal reporting. Try to think holistic first before more detailed.
2. From your derived metrics, what would you recommend as a first DS project?

### Additional question

At siteAssist, we deal with a lot of text data (answers to permit questions, reason for cancelling/amending/rejecting a permit). \
> **How would you pre-process this data to be used for both modelling and observational analysis?**
