Welcome to the Data Scientist take home exercise repo!

You will find one csv (dummy_data.csv) depicting our app’s backend live data. It contains permits’ statuses such as user requests, closures once the work has been completed etc…

You can use any programing language (our preffered and used one at siteAssist being Python).

### First Task
> **Your first task is be to infer at which state within the permit cycle a record is.**

***What we expect?***
1. Analyse the dataset to the best of your capacity. Don’t be afraid to challenge it if you feel it is not complete. 
2. Create some quick insights and potential visualisation of the data (EDA).
3. Define and implement an approach to solve the question above.

### Second Task
> **Your second task is to define a permit cycle funnel along with some success metrics to measure it.**

***What we expect?***
1. From this funnel, we should be able to label our data. It can then be used for some DS projects as well as for internal reporting. Try to think of a holistic view first before going into more details.
2. From your derived metrics, what would you recommend as a first DS project?

### Additional question

At siteAssist, we deal with a lot of text data (answers to permit questions, reason for cancelling/amending/rejecting a permit).
> **How would you pre-process this data to be used for both modelling and observational analysis?**
